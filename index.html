				<p>Welcome to Dogs dig the Sandbox. Our mission is to build trust and satisfy our customers with a customized well-built covered sandbox for their dogs to dig in, away from places they weren't supposed to.</p>
				
				<p>Are you frustrated and looking for a way to stop your dog from digging up the flower beds, garden, and the lawn and leaving holes everywhere? We have a solution for that. We design, build, and install enclosed covered sandboxes. Let us save the day with a safe place for them to dig, away from your flower beds, garden, and the lawn. They will thank you.</p> 

                <p>We know there are no two dogs alike and they come in all shapes and sizes. That is why our covered sandboxes are not built as a "one-size fits all." They are custom made with sturdy framing and a roof meant to last, including the concave cement floor to hold the sand within. We have three types of roofs with four different types of post and beams with many colors to choose from. Contact us to schedule an appointment. Our estimates and initial visits are <span class="action">FREE!</span></p>
