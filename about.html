				<h1>About Us</h1>
				<p>We started our business, "Dogs dig the Sandbox" in 2020. During Covid-19, like many of you, we were confined to our homes. Our dogs, Noodle the Doodle, and Pearl the German Shepherd Dog were getting depressed. Because they couldn’t play with their buddies at the park. They found another source to relieve their pint-up energy, which happened to be the backyard. They dug holes everywhere. It seemed as if one tried to dig a tunnel to the fence to escape (and almost made it), while the other tried to dig down to the middle of the Earth.</p>

				<p>They both like going to the beach and it struck us, “Why not build a sandbox?” Our next question was, “How do we stop Noodle and Empress from bringing the beach inside?”  And, just like that, we came up with our version of the perfect sandbox! Noodle and Pearl, both give it four paws up!</p>

				<p>Enjoy!</p>
